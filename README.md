# üî• LLM to Summarize Financial News

An AI-driven project that scrapes financial news, uses NLP models for summarization and entity extraction, and automates structured data storage in Google Sheets for analysis.

## üåü Features

**AI-Powered Summarization**: Transformer-based model (BART) that generates concise summaries of complex financial news articles.  
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extracts news data from sites like Times of India and Business Today using BeautifulSoup and Requests.  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detects and categorizes entities such as companies, organizations, and financial figures using spaCy.  
- **Structured Data Output**: Stores processed summaries and entities in organized tabular format using pandas.  
- **Google Sheets Sync**: Automatically updates summaries and key data points to Google Sheets through gspread API.  
- **Local CSV Export**: Enables offline access and data archival through CSV generation.  
- **Step-wise Modular Pipeline**: Clear stages from article extraction to summarization and cloud storage for transparency and debugging.  
- **Cloud-Optimized Execution**: Seamlessly deployable on Google Colab with GPU support for faster inference.  
- **Scalable & Extensible**: Easily extendable for sentiment analysis, trend prediction, or investment-focused data insights.

### **Web Scraping Module (Data Extraction)**
- **Purpose**: Collects raw financial news data from online sources.  
- **Libraries Used**: BeautifulSoup and Requests for HTML parsing and data retrieval.  
- **Data Sources**: Financial websites such as Times of India and Business Today.  
- **Functionality**: Identifies article titles, extracts body text, and filters relevant financial content.  
- **Output**: Cleaned text data passed to the AI Summarization module for further processing.

### **AI Summarization & Google Sheets Module (Data Processing & Storage)**
- **Summarization Model**: Transformer-based `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for generating concise financial summaries.  
- **Entity Extraction**: Uses spaCy to identify organizations, people, and key financial entities.  
- **Data Structuring**: Organizes results into pandas DataFrame with timestamps, URLs, summaries, and entity data.  
- **Cloud Integration**: Automatically uploads processed summaries to Google Sheets using gspread API.    
- **Execution Platform**: Fully compatible with Google Colab, supporting GPU acceleration for faster inference.

### **System Workflow**
1. Extracts financial news articles using the **Web Scraping Module**.  
2. Passes article content to the **AI Summarization Module** for processing.  
3. Generates summaries and extracts financial entities.  
4. Stores structured results both locally (CSV) and on Google Sheets.  
5. Enables future integration for trend detection, sentiment analysis, or investment prediction.
